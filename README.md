whole body workout made for beginer lifters 

8 week program 

4 days of work and then 3 days of rest 
cardio of at least 15-20 min as a warm up would be good and can be done on the rest days but always take one day off


if 3 days of rest is too much you can reduce the rest days to 1-2 days but 1 days of rest should have no work done on it.
